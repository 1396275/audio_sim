 *
 * Uses libmosquitto's own loop_start() background thread for network I/O —
 * same shape as our own custom socket threads (UdpInDeviceNode etc.), just
 * managed by the library instead of a juce::Thread we own directly.
 *
 * PAX_Value mapping (mirrors the OSC address/value split, same accepted
 * limitation): topic goes in data[] (PAX_DATA_STRING), numeric-parsed
 * payload goes in `value`. A non-numeric payload currently can't be
 * represented alongside the topic in the same collapsed PAX_Value — same
 * known limitation OSC already has with string args overwriting the address.
 * Fine for v1: the planned "MQTT → Value" Phase 4 adapter is scoped to
 * numeric payloads specifically.

     *  FIXED (2026-08-13): mosquitto_connect_async()'s DNS/hostname
     *  resolution is genuinely blocking (documented upstream limitation),
     *  so the whole connect sequence now runs on a background thread
     *  instead of here on the message thread. The tricky part isn't
     *  starting that thread — it's that JUCE can't forcibly kill a
     *  thread, so if this node is torn down (settings changed again, or
     *  the node deleted) while that thread is still stuck inside the one
     *  blocking mosquitto_connect_async() call, the thread can't notice
     *  and stop until that call finally returns. The old design would
     *  have raced: teardown() destroying the shared mosq handle while the
     *  background thread might still be using it.
     *
     *  Fixed properly via ownership, not timing: `connection` is a
     *  shared_ptr, captured by value into the launched thread's lambda.
     *  The thread never touches `this` at all — only the MqttConnection
     *  object and plain copies of the settings it needs. teardown() just
     *  drops this node's own reference; if the background thread still
     *  holds its own copy, the MqttConnection object — mosq handle,
     *  libmosquitto library ref, and all — stays alive until that thread
     *  finishes and releases its copy too, however long that takes,
     *  entirely independent of whether this node object still exists.
     *  Cleanup then happens automatically in ~MqttConnection(), safely,
     *  off the message thread, on whichever thread drops the last
     *  reference. */

/**
 * MqttPublishNode  (nodeType 23)
 *
 * 1 Value In port. Publishes each incoming PAX_Value to an MQTT broker.
 *
 * Topic: data[] overrides the configured topic when non-empty — mirrors
 * OSC Out's address-override convention, and composes naturally with
 * MqttSubscribeNode (topic-in-data[] on receive -> topic-in-data[] on
 * republish), so chaining Subscribe straight into Publish gives a working
 * "relay to the same topic" with zero special-casing.
 *
 * Payload: always the numeric `value`, formatted as plain decimal text
 * (e.g. "23.5") — matches common MQTT convention (Node-RED, Home
 * Assistant, etc. publish plain numeric strings, not JSON-wrapped). Same
 * v1 scoping as MqttSubscribeNode: numeric payloads only.
 *
 * Uses its own dedicated send thread + FIFO — same shape as
 * OscOutDeviceNode/UdpOutDeviceNode — rather than calling
 * mosquitto_publish() directly from process() (audio thread), since
 * libmosquitto's internal locking isn't guaranteed real-time-safe.
 *
 * NOTE: uses manualReset=false on its WaitableEvent, matching the same
 * fix later applied to OscOutDeviceNode/UdpOutDeviceNode (2026-08-13,
 * see Architecture.md Phase 6 table) — those two originally shipped with
 * manualReset=true and no .reset() call anywhere, a latent CPU-spin bug
 * (same root cause the DmxOutDeviceNode fix addressed first). This class
 * got manualReset=false correct from the start; it just wasn't yet fixed
 * in the two older files when this comment was first written.
