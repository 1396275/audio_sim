    // project (53 threads launched across the whole run — one test alone
    // launches 50 in a loop — all with zero cleanup opportunity the entire
    // time). A plain sleep here, rather than an explicit message-pump
    // call, gives whatever background cleanup mechanism JUCE actually uses
    // real wall-clock time to run on its own, without needing to know or
    // guess the exact API for it — a first attempt at this used
    // MessageManager::runDispatchLoopUntil(), which turned out not to
    // exist on this build; this avoids relying on getting that right.
