 * @file PaxAPI.h
 * @brief Patchy Pax API v4 (PAX) — the only header a Pax author needs.
 *
 * No JUCE dependency. No Patchy source dependency.
 *
 * Build your Pax as a shared library:
 *   macOS:   clang++ -std=c++17 -shared -fPIC MyNode.cpp -o MyNode.dylib
 *   Linux:   g++     -std=c++17 -shared -fPIC MyNode.cpp -o MyNode.so
 *   Windows: cl /std:c++17 /LD MyNode.cpp /Fe:MyNode.dll
 *
 * Drop the binary into the Patchy Pax folder and restart.
 *
 * @par API v2 changes (NGA_ → PAX_)
 *  - All symbols renamed from NGA_ to PAX_
 *  - PAX_process now receives a PAX_ProcessContext* instead of individual
 *    parameters — the signature will never grow again; future data types
 *    simply add fields to PAX_ProcessContext
 *  - PAX_Value + PAX_ValueBuffer added for DMX, OSC, MQTT, UDP and other
 *    protocol data types — value ports are live, routed by the host the
 *    same way audio/MIDI are (see valuesIn/valuesOut below)
 *  - PAX_API_VERSION bumped to 2
 *
 * @par API v3 changes
 *  - PAX_Value gained a `portIndex` field — lets a Pax with more than one
 *    Value output port (see PAX_getValueOutputCount/OutputType) say which
 *    specific port a written value belongs to, instead of every value
 *    implicitly going to "the" output. Needed for the host to route values
 *    to the correct downstream connection when a node has several
 *    differently-typed output ports (see PaxPortSpec in the host source for
 *    the design story) — mirrors how audio already routes per-port via
 *    dedicated buffer slots. 0 = first declared output port, the default
 *    if never set — correct as-is for every existing single-output Pax,
 *    no source change needed, just a rebuild (this is a genuine struct
 *    size change, hence the version bump — an un-rebuilt v2 Pax is cleanly
 *    rejected by the host's existing apiVersion check, not silently
 *    miscompiled against the new layout)
 *  - PAX_API_VERSION bumped to 3
 *
 * @par API v4 changes
 *  - PAX_ProcessContext gained a separate DMX universe path (dmxFrameIn/
 *    dmxFrameOut/dmxFrameInValid/dmxFrameOutValid) — PAX_Value.data[] is
 *    only 56 bytes, nowhere near enough for a full 512-channel DMX universe,
 *    which was silently truncating any Pax or built-in node trying to
 *    address more than the first 56 channels through the general Value
 *    mechanism. This is a parallel path, not a replacement — Value ports
 *    (valuesIn/valuesOut) are untouched and still the right choice for
 *    MQTT/OSC/UDP/single-value DMX; use the DMX frame fields specifically
 *    when a Pax needs to read or write the full 512-channel universe.
 *  - PAX_API_VERSION bumped to 4
